## Book Reading
1. We can compute f(1), f(2), ..., f(N) in a total of N(1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N) time.

   1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N is approximately O(log N) (Harmonic number)

2. Time complexity: O(NlogN + Q)

## The Equation
1. count the bit from the least significant bit 
 
   -> find the minimum possible value

2. change the bit from most significant bit 

   -> find the maximum value

## Shifts
1. divide the shifts into 2 sets, each having the size of at most ceil(N/2)

2. sorting one vector

3. find the lower bound value of the sorted vector 

4. Time complexity: O(3^(N/2) Ã— N)
