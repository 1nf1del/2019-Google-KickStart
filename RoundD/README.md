### X or What

- Xor **two xor-even numbers** or **two xor-odd numbers** , we can get a xor-even number

- Record the index of the **xor-odd number** in the set

- Two case

        a. When the size of the set is even
           -> the maximum value is n
            
        b. When the size of the set is odd
           -> the maximun value : (n-temp1-1) or temp2
               which temp1 is the maximum index value of the odd number
                     temp2 is the minimum index value of the odd number

### Latest Guests

- All guests having the same initial positions are in the same group and guests having different initial positions are in different groups. We maintain a mapping from guests to groups. We are going to find for each group, how many consulates remember it.
